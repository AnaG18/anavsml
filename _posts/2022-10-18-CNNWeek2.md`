# Learning about Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent and Neural Networks

So, I am very happy to share that I have finished the second week of the course [Neural Netwroks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)! 
I have had a rough time just making myself finish something, even if it is as easy as following an already structured Coursera course, so WAY TO GO! 

I will try to make a quick reminder of what I have seen throughout the course, try to summarize it in my own words and recall from memory. These are what I consider were the most important 
topics discussed at this point of the course. 

## Math reminders

### Derivatives

## Programming hacks! 

### Numpy, vectorization, and broadcasting

## Logistic Regression 

## Gradient Descent
