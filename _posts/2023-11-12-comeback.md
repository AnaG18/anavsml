# The comeback  
Well, it's been a rocky week. 

I guess the first step about learning Machine Learning is to forget you think you know something. 

I wish there was a clearer path on how to navigate this world of technology, computing and processing, but there isn't. So it has
been a double challenge to make one for myself that allows me to advance in my project without dropping my entire life
to pursue an entire CS major before completing my project. 

There isn't much to write for this week except a few reminders:

1. Always keep track of that *obvious thing you are not going to forget because is important for your project* because tomorrow you just might. 
2. Always make sure that the data type is correct (particularly when working on python
3. Taking a break and talking to someone else might just be the thing you need to solve your problems.

Sincerely, 
Ana
