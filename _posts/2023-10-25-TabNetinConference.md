# Discussing TabNet and my first conference

I have a very exciting event coming up this weekend. I am officially part of a conference! 

For the first time I get to present a poster, which I am second author on, in a conference talking about biomedical engineering. It is actually
my second time presenting a poster I made in front of an audience in a very cool research experience at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute
called [Robotics Institute Summer Scholars (RISS)](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/). It was a very different experience with a different audience. 

This is also the first Biomedical Engineering Conference I attend so I am really excited! 

Not that it really matters, but I present at the 24th Annual Alberta Biomedical Engineering Conference on Saturday with the 31# poster from 
11 to 12:30. 

One of my main goals with this goal is to practice my writing and vocabulary skills as I often find myself struggling very bad to find
the right words to say. So, I will attempt to describe a key component in the research I am presenting which is TabNet! 

## What the hell is TabNet? 

As far as I can say, with very simple words, TabNet is a Deep Learning architecture for tabular data.
